 Little bit of Architecture
 The whole Project will be created as a monolith app. Yopu may ask Me, why I chose that option? Well, the answer is simple, I dont't want to waste other people time in setting a few microservices (In case when someone wants to run my app <3).

Litle bit knowledge
For generating an unique shorten link I decided to chose Base32 encoding. Why this? The answer is simple, `Base32` encoding is much more human redable then for example `Base64`. Please take time and read https://www.connect2id.com/blog/how-to-generate-human-friendly-identifiers .
